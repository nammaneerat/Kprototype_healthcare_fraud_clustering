## Applying K-Prototype Clustering to Classify Health Care Provider Data in the US

This project aims to classify the nonlabel health care provider data and to identify fraudulent and nonfraudulent providers in the US. The healthcare provider data is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/tamilsel/healthcare-providers-data, and you can find the description of individual columns via the link.

Note that since K-Means works best with the numerical data, and K-Mode nicely handle clustering with categorical data, K-Prototype developed by Huang (1998) seems to be a clusterng method that is better to use with a mixed dataset, which will be applied in this project.
